# Map Segmentation action
# Provides interface to get the segmented map

# goal definition
sensor_msgs/Image input_map				# the action server need a map as a input image to segment it, IMPORTANT: The algorithm needs a black and white 8bit single-channel image, which is 0 (black) for obstacles and 256 (white) for free space
float32 map_resolution					# the resolution of the map in [meter/cell]
geometry_msgs/Pose map_origin			# the origin of the map in [meter]
bool return_format_in_pixel				# return room data (see below) in [pixel]
bool return_format_in_meter				# return room data (see below) in [meter]
float32 robot_radius					# in [meter]; if this variable is set to a value greater than 0, the room centers are chosen at locations that are reachable from neighboring rooms (i.e. not inside the legs of a table surrounded by chairs)

# for the following data: value in pixel can be obtained when the value of [return_format_in_pixel] from goal definition is true
# the computed room centers are not the centroids of the room cells (which could be located outside of the rooms)
# but accessible map pixels located within the center of the largest free space in the room
