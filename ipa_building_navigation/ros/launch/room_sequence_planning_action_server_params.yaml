# TSP Solver
# ==========
# indicates which TSP solver should be used
#   1 = Nearest Neighbor
#   2 = Genetic solver
#   3 = Concorde solver
# int
tsp_solver: 3

# Problem Setting
# ===============
# problem setting of the sequence planning problem
#   1 = SimpleOrderPlanning (plan the optimal order of a simple set of locations)
#   2 = CheckpointBasedPlanning (two-stage planning that creates local cliques of locations (= checkpoints) and determines
#                                the optimal order through the members of each clique as well as the optimal order through the cliques)
# int
problem_setting: 2

# Checkpoint-based Sequence Planning Specifics
# ============================================
# method that is used to plan the trolley positions (only applies to CheckpointBasedPlanning (2) problem_setting)
#   1 = drag the trolley if it is too far away from next room
#   2 = put rooms together in groups and calculate a corresponding trolley positions
# int
planning_method: 2

# max A* path length between two rooms that are assigned to the same clique, in [m] (only applies to CheckpointBasedPlanning (2) problem_setting)
# double
max_clique_path_length: 1200.0

# maximal nodes in one clique for one trolley position (only applies to CheckpointBasedPlanning (2) problem_setting)
# int
maximum_clique_size: 9001

# General Settings
# ================
# the map may be downsampled during computations (e.g. of A* path lengths) in order to speed up the algorithm,
# range of the factor [0 < factor <= 1] 
# if set to 1 the map will have original size, if set to 0 the algorithm won't work
# double
map_downsampling_factor: 0.25

# boolean to tell the sequence planner if it should check the given room centers for accessibility from the starting position
# bool
check_accessibility_of_rooms: true

# boolean to tell the server if the map with the sequence drawn in should be returned
# bool
return_sequence_map: false

# displays the map with paths upon service call (only if return_sequence_map=true)
# bool
display_map: false
